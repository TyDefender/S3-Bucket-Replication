<h1>Cross-Region S3 Bucket with Replication</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
During this lab, I explored the functionality of Amazon S3, focusing on the automatic replication of objects stored in our S3 bucket to a different region across the country. The purpose of this process is to ensure the accessibility of our files under various scenarios, particularly those involving potential data loss.

Throughout the lab, I successfully learned how to create S3 buckets and implement automatic replication, providing a secure backup for files in a geographically separate location. This hands-on experience has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to safeguard our data and maintain accessibility even in challenging circumstances.
